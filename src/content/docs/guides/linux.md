description: How kakemono picks a wallpaper backend on Linux, the command each backend runs, and the setup that tiling compositors need.
---

On Linux, kakemono sets the wallpaper through a backend: a desktop API, or a command such as `swww` or `feh`. This page explains how kakemono picks the backend, lists the command each backend runs, and covers the setup that some sessions need.

Two commands show what kakemono sees:

- `kakemono detect` shows the backend for the current session and why kakemono picked it. `--write` saves it to `[desktop]`.
- `kakemono doctor` shows the environment, the command a `set` would run, and what the running daemon uses. `--apply` asks the daemon to set the current wallpaper again.

On macOS and Windows, kakemono always uses the system API and ignores `backend` and `set_command`.

## How kakemono picks a backend

The `[desktop]` section of `config.toml` controls the backend. The daemon fills it in on the first start.

| Key | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `backend` | `auto`, `native`, `gnome`, `kde`, `xfce`, `cinnamon`, `mate`, `sway`, `hyprpaper`, `awww`, `swww`, `swaybg`, `wbg`, `xwallpaper`, `feh`, `nitrogen`, `hsetroot`, `pcmanfm`, `pcmanfm-qt`, `command` | `auto` |
| `set_command` | An argv array, or a string that kakemono splits like a shell would. kakemono never runs it through a shell. | unset |
| `persistent` | `true` if `set_command` keeps running, like `swaybg` | `false` |
| `fit` | `fill`, `fit`, `center`, `stretch`, `tile` | `fill` |
| `theme` | `auto`, `light`, `dark`. Overrides the system theme when kakemono can't read it, for example on a bare X11 window manager. | `auto` |
| `managed_by` | `detect` lets kakemono rewrite `[desktop]` when the session changes. `user` means kakemono never touches it. | `detect` |
| `detected_session` | Written by kakemono, for example `"hyprland:wayland"` | unset |
| `detected_at` | Written by kakemono, an RFC 3339 time | unset |

On Linux, `native` means the same as `auto`.

kakemono resolves the backend in this order. The first match wins.

1. **A pinned backend.** kakemono uses any `backend` other than `auto` or `native` as is. There is one exception. With `managed_by = "detect"`, if `detected_session` doesn't match the current session, kakemono detects again. For example, this happens when you log in to GNOME after Hyprland.
2. **A full desktop environment**, from the first of `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, `XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP`, and `DESKTOP_SESSION` that is set. kakemono also picks `kde` when `KDE_FULL_SESSION=true`, or when `org.kde.plasmashell` is on the session bus and no compositor variable is set.
3. **A wallpaper daemon that is already running.** kakemono checks for `awww-daemon`, `swww-daemon`, `hyprpaper`, and `wpaperd`, in that order.
4. **The compositor.** kakemono checks `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE`, `SWAYSOCK`, and `NIRI_SOCKET`, then any Wayland session.
5. **An X11 setter**, in an X11 session with no known desktop environment.
6. **Unconfigured.** kakemono can't set a wallpaper. `doctor` and the daemon's error say what to install or configure.

### Detection results

| What kakemono finds | Backend |
|---|---|
| Desktop name `kde`, `plasma`, `plasmawayland`, or `plasmax11` | `kde` |
| Desktop name `gnome`, `gnome-xorg`, `gnome-wayland`, `gnome-classic`, `gnome-flashback`, `ubuntu`, `ubuntu-wayland`, `ubuntu-xorg`, `pop`, `unity`, `budgie`, or `budgie-desktop` | `gnome` |
| Desktop name `x-cinnamon`, `cinnamon`, `cinnamon2d`, or `cinnamon-wayland` | `cinnamon` |
| Desktop name `mate` | `mate` |
| Desktop name `xfce` or `xfce4` | `xfce` |
| Desktop name `lxqt` | `pcmanfm-qt` |
| Desktop name `lxde` | `pcmanfm` |
| Desktop name `cosmic` | `command`. COSMIC has no wallpaper command that kakemono can drive, so you must set `set_command`. |
| `awww-daemon` is running | `awww` |
| `swww-daemon` is running | `swww` |
| `hyprpaper` is running | `hyprpaper` |
| `wpaperd` is running | `command`. wpaperd manages the wallpaper itself. Stop wpaperd, or set `set_command`. |
| Hyprland | The first installed of `hyprpaper`, `awww`, `swww`, and `swaybg`. If none is installed, the next row applies. |
| sway | `sway` (`swaymsg output * bg`) |
| niri, or another Wayland session | The first installed of `awww`, `swww`, `swaybg`, and `wbg` |
| X11, no known desktop | The first installed of `xwallpaper`, `feh`, `nitrogen`, and `hsetroot` |
| No `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`, or `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` | Unconfigured |

kakemono matches desktop names without regard to case. It splits `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` on `:` and uses the first name it knows, so `ubuntu:GNOME` selects `gnome`.

### When kakemono saves the result

On start, the daemon detects the backend and writes it to `[desktop]` with `detected_session` and `detected_at`. A later start with the same session reuses the saved backend. The daemon doesn't write to `[desktop]` in these cases:

- `managed_by = "user"`.
- `backend = "native"`, which makes the daemon detect again on every start.
- `backend` is already pinned for this session (step 1 above).
- The detected backend can't set a wallpaper: unconfigured, or `command` without `set_command`.
- `set_command` is set and the detected backend is not `command`.

`kakemono detect --write` saves the detected backend from your shell. It refuses a section with `managed_by = "user"` unless you pass `--force`.

## Commands that each backend runs

The desktop backends set the wallpaper through the desktop's own settings:

| Backend | How | `fill`, `fit`, `center`, `stretch`, `tile` |
|---|---|---|
| `gnome` | `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background`: `picture-uri` and `picture-uri-dark` to `{uri}`, then `picture-options` | `zoom`, `scaled`, `centered`, `stretched`, `wallpaper` |
| `cinnamon` | `gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.background`: `picture-uri` to `{uri}`, then `picture-options` | Same as `gnome` |
| `mate` | `gsettings set org.mate.background`: `picture-filename` to `{path}`, then `picture-options` | Same as `gnome` |
| `kde` | A Plasma script sent over D-Bus (`org.kde.plasmashell` `evaluateScript`) that sets `Image` and `FillMode` on every desktop | `FillMode` 2, 1, 6, 0, 3 |
| `xfce` | xfconf over D-Bus: every `/backdrop/.../last-image` key of `xfce4-desktop`, plus its `image-style` | `image-style` 5, 4, 1, 3, 2 |

GNOME older than 42 has no `picture-uri-dark` key. That one step fails, and the `set` still succeeds.

XFCE has no `last-image` keys until you set a wallpaper once in **Desktop Settings**. Until then, `set` fails and says so.

The preset backends run one command per `set`. `{path}` is the absolute image path.

| Backend | `fill` | `fit` | `center` | `stretch` | `tile` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sway` | `swaymsg output * bg {path} fill` | `... fit` | `... center` | `... stretch` | `... tile` |
| `hyprpaper` | `hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper ,{path}` | `hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper ,contain:{path}` | Same as `fill` | Same as `fill` | `hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper ,tile:{path}` |
| `awww` | `awww img {path} --resize crop --transition-type fade` | `--resize fit` | `--resize no` | `--resize stretch` | `--resize no` |
| `swww` | `swww img {path} --resize crop --transition-type fade` | `--resize fit` | `--resize no` | `--resize stretch` | `--resize no` |
| `swaybg` | `swaybg -i {path} -m fill` | `-m fit` | `-m center` | `-m stretch` | `-m tile` |
| `wbg` | `wbg {path}` | Same | Same | Same | Same |
| `xwallpaper` | `xwallpaper --zoom {path}` | `--maximize` | `--center` | `--stretch` | `--tile` |
| `feh` | `feh --bg-fill {path}` | `--bg-max` | `--bg-center` | `--bg-scale` | `--bg-tile` |
| `nitrogen` | `nitrogen --set-zoom-fill --save {path}` | `--set-zoom` | `--set-centered` | `--set-scaled` | `--set-tiled` |
| `hsetroot` | `hsetroot -cover {path}` | `-full` | `-center` | `-fill` | `-tile` |
| `pcmanfm` | `pcmanfm --set-wallpaper {path} --wallpaper-mode=crop` | `=fit` | `=center` | `=stretch` | `=tile` |
| `pcmanfm-qt` | `pcmanfm-qt --set-wallpaper {path} --wallpaper-mode=zoom` | `=fit` | `=center` | `=stretch` | `=tile` |

The full argv of every preset is in the snapshot [`crates/platform/tests/it/snapshots/it__linux_presets__presets.snap`](https://github.com/RielJ/kakemono/blob/main/crates/platform/tests/it/snapshots/it__linux_presets__presets.snap). `cargo test -p kakemono-platform --test linux_presets` checks it.

`swaybg` and `wbg` keep running while they show the wallpaper. For each `set`, kakemono starts a new instance, waits for it to draw, and then stops the old one. It records the PID in `<runtime dir>/setter.pid` and takes over that process when the daemon restarts.

The list of desktops and commands was checked against [Variety](https://github.com/varietywalls/variety), which supports many of the same desktops. Variety is GPL-3, so kakemono contains none of its code. The backends follow each desktop's public documentation.

## Use your own command

To run your own command, set `backend = "command"` and `set_command`:

```toml
[desktop]
backend = "command"
set_command = ["awww", "img", "{path}", "--transition-type", "grow"]
managed_by = "user"
```

`set_command` takes these placeholders:

- `{path}`: the absolute path.
- `{uri}`: a `file://` URI.
- `{fit}`: the `fit` value.
- `{theme}`: `light` or `dark`.

A placeholder value never splits into two arguments, even if it has spaces. For shell features, call the shell yourself: `["sh", "-c", "my-setter \"$1\"", "_", "{path}"]`.

If the command keeps running, as `swaybg` does, set `persistent = true`. kakemono then replaces the old instance on every `set`.

`set_command` with a preset backend, for example `backend = "swww"`, replaces the preset's argv.

`managed_by = "user"` stops the daemon from replacing your section when the session changes.

## The systemd service needs your session environment

`kakemono service install` writes `~/.config/systemd/user/kakemono.service`, under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` if set, then enables and starts it. The unit runs `kakemono daemon -f`, is part of `graphical-session.target`, and restarts on failure after 5 seconds. Logs go to the journal: `journalctl --user -u kakemono`.

A systemd user service sees only the environment of the systemd user manager, not the environment of your compositor. If the manager doesn't have `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`, `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, or `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE`, two things go wrong. The daemon detects the wrong backend or none, and commands like `swww` can't reach the compositor. GNOME and KDE import these variables for you. Most tiling compositors don't.

To fix it, import the variables before the service starts. In Hyprland:

```text title="~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf"
exec-once = dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE
```

In sway:

```text title="~/.config/sway/config"
exec dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP SWAYSOCK
```

Many compositors don't start `graphical-session.target` at all. In that case, start the daemon from the compositor config instead of the service. The daemon refuses to run twice, so this is safe even with the service installed:

```text title="~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf"
exec-once = kakemono daemon
```

```text title="~/.config/sway/config"
exec kakemono daemon
```

For niri, add `spawn-at-startup "kakemono" "daemon"` to `config.kdl`. `kakemono service install` prints these lines with the full path to your `kakemono` binary.

To check what the daemon sees, run `kakemono doctor`. The **Session (this shell)** section shows your shell's environment. The **Daemon** section shows the backend that the running daemon uses. If the two differ, the service is missing part of your session environment.

## The tray icon needs a StatusNotifier host

The kakemono tray icon needs a StatusNotifier host. KDE Plasma and most bars, such as waybar, have one. On GNOME, install the AppIndicator extension.

## Picker window rules

The picker is a small window with the title `kakemono-picker`. On X11, macOS, and Windows, kakemono places it at the edge set by [`[picker] position`](/reference/configuration/#picker). On native Wayland, the compositor decides where windows go, so add window rules that match the title. Match the title, not the app ID or class, because the picker and the Settings window share one app ID.

`kakemono doctor` prints the rules for Hyprland, sway, and niri when it detects one of them.

sway:

```text title="~/.config/sway/config"
for_window [title="^kakemono-picker$"] floating enable, sticky enable, border none, move position center
```

Hyprland:

```text title="~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf"
windowrulev2 = float, title:^(kakemono-picker)$
windowrulev2 = pin, title:^(kakemono-picker)$
windowrulev2 = noborder, title:^(kakemono-picker)$
# Optional: a full-width strip at the bottom instead of a centred window.
windowrulev2 = size 100% 160, title:^(kakemono-picker)$
windowrulev2 = move 0 100%-160, title:^(kakemono-picker)$
```

niri:

```text title="~/.config/niri/config.kdl"
window-rule {
    match title="^kakemono-picker$"
    open-floating true
}
```

On Hyprland and sway, if you drag the picker somewhere else, kakemono saves the spot as `[picker] placement = "custom"`. The next time the picker opens, kakemono moves it there.

`[picker] force_x11 = true` runs the picker under XWayland, where kakemono can place it without window rules. The option is experimental and off by default, because XWayland windows can look blurry with fractional scaling.

## Blank windows on NVIDIA

WebKitGTK draws the picker and Settings windows. On NVIDIA drivers, it can show blank or white windows. To fix it, set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` in the environment that starts the kakemono app:

```sh
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 kakemono-ui
```

`kakemono pick` and `kakemono settings` pass their environment to the app when they start it, so this works too:

```sh
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 kakemono settings
```

If the app is already running, it keeps its own environment. Quit the app first.

To set the variable for every start in a session that starts through systemd, such as GNOME or KDE Plasma, add it to `~/.config/environment.d/kakemono.conf`:

```text title="~/.config/environment.d/kakemono.conf"
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1
```

In other sessions, export it in the compositor config or the shell profile that starts the app.

The daemon doesn't use WebKit, so wallpaper rotation works without this setting.
